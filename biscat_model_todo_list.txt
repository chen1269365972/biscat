Biscat Model Todo List:
===============================================================================

Bugs:
- After loading config file, Neural Transduction subpanel does not match RCF, BIO, or RND selection
- LIF model parameters - something preventing data entry & default to zero after load
- Gammatone TF discontinuous below 20kHz (w/ 2MHz sampling rate)
- Gammachirp takes very long time bouncing between prony/stmcb and yields invalid TF
- Cheby I filter:  Shouldn't this be cheby II?
- FIR LS bandwidth too wide (order too low???)
- Cochlear Block panel should not allow you to deselect a filter type
- Bandwidth/Q doesn't affect constant Q designs

Immediate:
- Add Meddis (2006) IHC neural transduction models
- Add "absolute" refractory period to spike thinning algorithm
- Add raster plot for visualizing neural discharge times across cell population (starting with AN)
- Add LIF model per AN to simulate bushy cells in the AVCN

Near-term:
- Incorporate Rectification and Envelope Filter in Cochlear Filterbank section
- Add binaural processing mode - input signal can be mono or stereo channels, mono channel duplicated until random generation

Long-term:
- Add vizualization (TS, SG, PWV) to post-outer/middle ear response
- Add Meddis (2008) - AMS code/tutorials downloaded from Meddis' website
- Add Heil model to Neural Transduction tab
- Include external ear notch filter to include notch frequency for boresight incident sound (may be moved to HRTF if data exists)
- Add DRNL filter to basilar membrane options
- Incorporate monte-carlo analysis mode for non-deterministic models & simulation of SCAT w/ noise in signal
- Change pole-zero plot to be more visual
- Allow both absolute/refractory period in AN Response model
